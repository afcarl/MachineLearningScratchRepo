# UTSC Machine Learning Series

Welcome to the github repository for our UTSC Machine Learning Workshop.
Here you can find all the relevant files.
In particular, you can find the presentation files for each day in their own separate folder.
Many of the presentations are based on Kevin Markham's no free hunch series of machine learning lessons:
